I am Rejan, a high-schooler currently studying at the Athénée de Luxembourg. I enjoy mathematics and like learning about various topics ranging from numerical analysis and special-functions approximation to category theory. 

This blog is a place for me to document my maths-learning journey and share other topics I find interesting.
