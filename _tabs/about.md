I am Rejan, a high-schooler currently studying at the Athénée de Luxembourg. I enjoy mathematics and like learning about various topics ranging from numerical analysis and special-functions approximations to category theory. 

This blog is a place for me to document my maths-learning journey and share topics I find interesting. 

I am currently reading Categories for the Working Mathematician by Mac Lane, as well as Algebraic Topology by Hatcher, though to a lesser extent, so these will likely influence the nature of my posts for the foreseeable future.
