I recently watched a video by [Sheafification of g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uI0uJpsEhI) about limits. Unlike the limits in calculus, limits in category theory seem more appealing and interesting to me. So, in the spirit of that video, and since I have yet to come up with any better ideas for this post, I will provide some more examples of them, although the general construction is discussed in the video.



Generally speaking, a limit (when it may exist), is a "best representative" of a diagram, in the sense that other objects map through it (i.e. an arrow $f: A \to C$ factors through an object $B$ if there exist arrows $g: A \to B$ and $h: B \to C$ such that $f = h \circ g$). 

An example of limits is that of equalisers. 
Let us consider the following diagram in $\mathbf{Set}$:

For this diagram, the equaliser $\text{E}$ is defined as the set of elements in $A$ such that $f(a) = g(a)$, i.e. $$\text{E}= \{a \in A \mid f(a) = g(a)\},$$ together with the inclusion map $i: \text{E} \hookrightarrow A$. 

$\text{E}$ is a limit because for some object $X$ with a map $h: X \to A$ such that $f \circ h = g \circ h$, $X$ must necessarily factor through $\text{E}$. The following diagram will probably help make this clearer:

The condition $f \circ h = g \circ h$ also serves an equalising role of sorts: we may rewrite it as $f(h(x)) = g(h(x))$ for $x \in X$, and notice that this must be a subset of $E$ since $h(x) \in A$.
Concretely, we may think of $u$ as the same map as $h$, but now its codomain is $E$ instead of $A$. Composing $u$ with the inclusion $e: E \hookrightarrow A$ gives back $h$. Thus, $h = e \circ u$, meaning that $X$ must factor through $E$, and the equaliser $E$ is the limit of this diagram.

All this is cool and all, but evidently I have yet to properly define what a limit is (and the universal property of a limit required to formalise it), which I suppose I will do now.

Formally speaking, let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let $D$ be a diagram in $\mathcal{C}$. A limit of the diagram $D$ is an object $L \in \mathcal{C}$ together with a family of morphisms $\pi_{X_i}: L \to X_i$ (one for each object $X_i, i \in {1, 2, ...}$) such that for every $f: X \to Y$ in $D$, $\pi_Y = f \circ \pi_X$, and for any other object $T$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with morphisms $\tau_{X_i}$ that are compatible with the diagram (so $\tau_Y = f \circ \tau_X$ for all $f: X \to Y$), there exists a unique morphism $u: T \to L$ such that $\tau_{X_i} = \pi_{X_i} \circ u$ for all $X$ in $D.$
Notably, the second condition for the limit is known as the universal property of a limit. 

In the equaliser example, the limit is $E$ with projection map $e$, and the universal property is shown by $h = e \circ u$ for any $h: X \to A$ such that $f \circ h = g \circ h$.

To give another example of limits, I will talk about the fiber product (pullback) in $\mathbf{CRing}$ (the category of commutative rings with unity).

Let us consider the following cospan

where $R, S$ and $C$ are commutative rings, and $f, g$ are ring homomorphisms.
Then, we can construct a limit object 
$$
L := R \times_C S := \{ (r,s) \in R \times S \mid f(r) = g(s) \text{ in } C \},
$$
together with projection maps 
$$
\pi_1: R \times_C S \to R,(r,s) \mapsto r$$ and 
$$
\pi_2: R \times_C S \to S, (r,s) \mapsto s.
$$
This yields the square

Finally, to ensure the universal property, we consider the initial object $\mathbb{Z}$ (since it is the initial object of $\mathbf{CRing}$), and maps $\tau_1, \tau_2$ to construct fibre product diagram (equivalently, pullback diagram).

You can check that the conditions for the limit hold, and $R \times_C S$ is the limit. 

Please do point out any mistakes, and I hope you enjoyed this trivial post on limits.
