While I claimed in the "About" page that I might write about numerical analysis or special functions, I am increasingly inclined to say that this was a lie. With every passing day, algebra wins. And because categorical limits for a first (actual) blog post were apparently not sufficiently overkill, I realised as I was learning about the basics of the $\text{Ext}$ and $\text{Tor}$ derived functors that there could hardly be a better topic for a second (and third) post than the two most common derived functors and their idiosyncrasies. 

We begin this story in exact-sequence land, because that's ultimately what all of algebra is about. This is a heavily flawed statement. Nevertheless, I digress.

Exact-sequence land is practically any abelian category. However, I still don't really fully understand abelian categories, so I will just use $\text{R-Mod}$. Concretely, $\text{R-Mod}$ is the category of all left-modules over a fixed ring $R$. Furthermore, I will assume that $R$ is commutative so that left-and-right-modules are the same. To even start considering $\text{Ext}$ and $\text{Tor}$, an exact sequence is needed. Suppose $A, B, C$ are $R$-modules, with maps $f: A \to B $ and $g: B \to C$. Furthermore, we impose that at every step, the image of the previous map equals the kernel of the next map:
$$
\text{ker}(f) = \text{im}(0) = 0 \hspace{5px}(\text{Exact at} A), \hspace{5px}
\text{im}(f) = \text{ker}(g)\hspace{5px} (\text{Exact at} B), \hspace{5px}
\text{im}(g) = \text{ker}(0) \hspace{5px}(\text{Exact at} C). \hspace{5px}$$

We can represent this using the following diagram:

To understand $\Ext^1(-, -)$, one must first look at extensions. How coincidental is it that a functor classifying extensions is called $\Ext$? (Not at all.)

An extension of a module $C$ by a module $A$ is just a module $B$ "sitting in between them" in a short exact sequence. We say that the short exact sequence above is an extension of $C$ by $A$, and the extension is $B.$ If this sequence splits, meaning that $B \cong A \oplus C$, it is a trivial extension (this requires a map $s: C \to B$ such that $g \circ s = \t{id}_C$). If it does not, it is nontrivial. Wow, such vivid language and imagery. 

Then, $\Ext^1_R(C, A)$ is the set of extensions of $C$ by $A$, where the subscript $R$ is just the ring $R$ we work over. $\Ext^1$ is the one we care about here, since $\Ext^0_R(C, A) \cong \Hom_R (C, A),$ and $\Ext^2$ classifies 2-extensions, which I don't quite understand yet.
Generally speaking, to compute $\Ext^1$, we need a projective resolution of the first argument $C$. 
To explain, or not to explain, that is the question of projective resolutions. Well, it would be foolish to talk of $\Ext$ without mentioning and briefly giving an overview of (projective) resolutions. Roughly speaking, a projective resolution is a way of "representing" a module $C$ using really nice modules, e.g. projective modules. The most evident projective modules are free modules over $R$. 
A projective resolution is then an exact sequence of the following form:
![full projective resolution](/assets/img/fullproj.png)

where each $P_n$ is projective (in our case, a free module). Since this sequence is exact, $\t{im}(d_1) = \t{ker}(\varepsilon)$, so $C$ may be omitted and expressed implicitly with the understanding that $\t{coker}(d_1) = P_0/\t{im}(d_1) = P_0/\t{ker}(\varepsilon) \cong C.$ So, equivalently, we can use the following diagram:
![abbreviated projective resolution](/assets/img/briefproj.png)

To continue the quest for defining $\Ext^1_R(C, A)$, we apply the contravariant $\Hom_R(-, A).$ Since it is contravariant, we must flip the arrows. We get (yet another) sequence. This time, though, it is not necessarily exact. It is a cochain complex of the following form:
![hom!](/assets/img/projhom.png)

This sequence is not exact, since $\Hom_R(-, A)$ is only left-exact, meaning that in this case it is exact at $0 \to \Hom_R(P_0, A),$ not necessarily anywhere else along the cochain complex.
It appears we have reached the end of our journey...for $\Ext$, at least. Finally, $$\Ext^n_R(C, A) = \text{ker}(d_{n+1}^{*})/\text{im}(d_n^{*})$$. Since we care about $\Ext^1,$ we write
$$ \Ext^1_R(C, A) = \text{ker}(d^*_{2})/\text{im}(d^*_1)$$. If this reminds you of anything, it's because this is cohomology. (Homology surprise appearance: #1)

Side note, I do not particularly wish to show why $\Ext^0_R(C, A) = \Hom_R(C, A),$ since plenty of proofs can be found online. Here, then, we just take it for granted that for a derived functor $R^i$ of a functor $F$, $R^0 F \cong F,$ though I have yet to even explain what a "derived functor" is. (Hint: it may have something to do with exactness...surprising? I didn't think so.)

With $\Ext$ out of the way, I have to discuss $\Tor.$ However, since this post is getting quite lengthy, I will continue it in another post soon.
